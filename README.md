# Portfolio Optimization Challenges

Welcome to the **Portfolio Optimization Challenges** repository! This repository is designed for participants of the Portfolio Optimization Workshop to practice and enhance their portfolio management and quantitative finance skills. Choose one challenge, run the provided code, and explore the fascinating world of portfolio optimization.



## About This Repository

This repository contains hands-on challenges focused on **Modern Portfolio Optimization (MVO)** and **Risk Management**. Participants will implement advanced concepts like the **Capital Market Line (CML)**, **sensitivity analysis**, and **alternative risk measures** to gain a deeper understanding of portfolio theory.



## Challenges

### 1. Implement the Capital Market Line (CML) in MVO
- **Objective**: Incorporate a risk-free asset (e.g., short-term Treasury rate) into your MVO simulation. Identify the Market Portfolio as the tangency point on the Efficient Frontier.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Add a risk-free asset to your optimization model.
  - Combine risk-free and risky assets using the CML.
  - Visualize how the CML enhances portfolio choices.

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis for Mean and Variance Estimates
- **Objective**: Understand the impact of estimation error by varying expected returns and covariances in your Monte Carlo MVO.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Perform a sensitivity analysis by tweaking mean and variance estimates.
  - Analyze how small changes influence portfolio composition and efficiency.

### 3. Create Alternative Risk Measures
- **Objective**: Explore alternative ways to evaluate portfolio performance by implementing a risk measure like the **Sortino Ratio**, which focuses on downside risk.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Calculate and compare portfolio performance using both the **Sharpe Ratio** and the **Sortino Ratio**.
  - Evaluate differences and implications for portfolio decisions.
